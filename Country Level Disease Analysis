This project leverages Power BI to visualize and analyze disease trends across different counties, with a focus on key metrics like disease rates, population data, and demographic breakdowns. Using KPI and card visuals, the dashboard provides insights into the overall disease burden, trends over time, and variations by sex and county. The analysis also highlights the uncertainty in rate estimates using confidence intervals, supporting data-driven decision-making in public health.
