# Power-BI-Project
This is a simple project done using Power BI to find out why ABC company keeps having high priority ticket. ABC Company's high number of ticket are caused by syste failures or access/login issues, given that these departments handle large volume of tickets. Unassigned ticket also fall into high priority categogies, delaying responses and resolution.
